# DiceProject
Various Die Rollers

This repo contains a Die class that can be instantiated with any positive, whole number of sides.
It contains methods for rolling any positive, whole number of itself and displaying console output of the results and total.

Also contained herein is a module for rolling dice in the Dungeons and Dragons or D20 dice system. This module is set up to accept command line input such as "3d6 + 1d8 + 2". This module supports the standard range of dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, and 100 sided) and two arithmetic operators (+ and -).

This repo will be expanded with modules to simulate other dice systems over time.
